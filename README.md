## Installation

---

First you would need to `git clone` the repository, then go into the repo on your local machine. From there simply run an `npm i` or `npm install` to download the necessary packages.

## Usage

---

Once you have the project installed, you just need to run the `server.js` so you can test any changes made locally as well as ensuring any additional fetchs work as intended. If you'd rather do things the easy way, don't install the project at all. Just go the link provided and use it for yourself. From the start up screen `click` the 'Get Started' button, then on the notes page just type your note into the indicated fields and press the save icon to save it. You can also click the Trash icon to DELETE any saved note.

## Contributing

If you wanted to contribute, just install the project as described above and start making any changes you see fit. I'll happily approve and implement any change that boosts the functionality and responsiveness of the app.
